# PHY3075 - Advanced Computational Physics - H17

This repository contains the projects for the advanced computational physics class I took during Winter 2017 at the Université de Montréal. The name of the class if french is *Modélisation numérique en physique*.

The various projects are organized as such:

* Each project is regrouped in its own folder, named **P#_\_Subject\_of\_project_**
* In each folder, you will find the PDF version of the project report, named **P#_\_Name\_of\_project_.pdf**. You will notice that the name of the project is different from the subject of the project itself. For example, the project on neural networks consisted of classifying examples between detection or not of the Higgs Boson and is thus called *Higgs\_Boson* instead of *Neural\_Networks*.
* You will also find the various codes for each project with *.py* extensions. I have tried to be as specific as possible when naming them.
